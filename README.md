# Xpressway

HDFC has a popular banking service called the "Xpressway" which aims at making banking simpler. However, their user-interface does not live up to the mark.
I went through certain websites and tried to recreate "Xpressway" in the way they are designed. 

<b>Note:</b> 
<aside>
This is just a project made by me. Neither is it a part of the original website nor am I related to HDFC, by any means.
Any similarities, if found in my website by any means, are absolutely coincidental. 
The logo I used, has been edited, and is not the exact one used by the official website.
