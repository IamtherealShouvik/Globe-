# Xpressway

HDFC has a popular banking service called the "Xpressway" which aims at making banking simpler. However, their user-interface does not live up to the mark.
I went through certain websites and tried to recreate "Xpressway" in the way they are designed. This is not the ultimate design, just the first draft, which will be remastered in the future.

<h2>Note:</h2> 
This is just a project made by me. Neither is it a part of the original website nor am I related to HDFC, by any means.<br>
Any similarity, if found, is absolutely coincidental. The favicon has been edited &amp; is not the exact one used by the official website.
